## About the Video Course
With the rise of start-ups and self-made business, Network Engineering for small businesses has seen an increase in demand, and businesses are always on the lookout for engineers who can configure networks that meet their needs and provide support once they’re set up. Cisco provides a number of options both in terms of hardware and software to address these networking needs at various levels.

In this video tutorial, we dive right into implementing Cisco Voice Solutions for your small business. You’ll learn to design your network and work with different network topologies. In the first section, you’ll explore the different hardware options over your network, and how they are brought together to create your basic connection. You’ll learn to install and work with modems, routers, and analog telephones. Next, you’ll dive into implementing Gateway and Trunk Connections with various hardware options provided by Cisco. 
Moving on, you’ll learn to set up a fax system for your organization’s end points, and extend that with voice connections such as Google Voice. After that, you’ll dive into different topologies and learn to implement each of these depending on the requirement. You’ll see how to configure your network, practically manage your device’s IP addresses, and work with different Cisco dial plans. Finally, you’ll find out how to verify and validate calls made over your network, efficiently managing your network’s incoming and outgoing traffic.

By the end of this course, you will be well-versed with building, configuring, and maintaining an efficient voice network for your small business.
